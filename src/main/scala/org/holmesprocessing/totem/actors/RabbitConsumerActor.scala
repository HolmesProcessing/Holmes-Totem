/**
 * This actor will register itself to consume messages from the configured RabbitMQ server. This gets a dedicated thread, and a
 * new consumer should be created for each queue that we need to consume from. This is a cleaner design overall. Should
 * multiple queues be needed, their dispatcher will get a dedicated thread. As a result, messages of varying formats should be routed
 * through differing queues, whereas messages of the same format can be routed through the same queue through the use of RMQ topics.
 *
 * This is generally the top of an actor hierarchy, and creates its own WorkGroupActor immediately. The hierarchy resembles
 * Consumer -> WorkGroupActor -*-> WorkActor
 *
 * Something like:
 * {{{
 * val myGetter: ActorRef = system.actorOf(RabbitConsumerActor.props[ZooWork](hostConfig, exchangeConfig, queueConfig, Parsers.parseJ), "consumer")
 * }}}
 * is the preferred way to create this actor.
 *
 * The following is a listing of the message types that this Actor explicitly handles, and a brief discussion of their purpose.
 * {{{
 *   case RabbitMessage(deliveryTag: Long, body: Array[Byte]) => {
 *     When a new RMQ message is returned from the callback, take it, attempt to parse the ZooWork JSON out of it, and pass to the
 *     WorkGroup actor for handling. Decrement totalDemand, so that we do not attempt to consume the world.
 *   }
 *
 *   case Ack(n: Long) => {
 *     After the completion of a provided job, the ConsumerActor must acknowledge that the work has been processed. This is
 *     called regardless of whether or not the Job, or it's component Work elements are successes or failures on the Service
 *     side.
 *   }
 *
 *  case NAck(n: Long) => {
 *    This is provided to NACK a specific job, and allow it to be reprocessed. This is only called if there is a failure within
 *    TOTEM itself, or the binary associated with the Job cannot be successfully downloaded.
 *  }
 * }}}
 *
 * @constructor Create a new RabbitConsumerActor, which consumes JSON formatted RabbitMessages from RMQ, transforms them
 *             into objects of type [T], and emits those objects to the state actor groups.
 * @param host: a HostSettings object, responsible for holding the server configuration to use.
 * @param exchange: an ExchangeSettings object, holds the exchange configuration.
 * @param queue: a QueueSettings object, holds queue configuration.
 * @param servicelist: the WorkEncoding object that is used to parse the component Work elements that comprise a Job
 * @param decoder: a Parsers.Parser[T], which is responsible for transforming the JSON data into a Scala object.
