/**
 * This actor will register itself to deliver messages to the RabbitMQ server. This gets a dedicated thread, and a
 * new producer should be created for each exchange that we need to deliver to. This is a cleaner design overall. Should
 * multiple exchanges be needed, their dispatcher will get a dedicated thread, and the actors themselves, as they are lightweight
 * processes, will share it.
 *
 * Something like:
 * {{{
 * val myGetter: ActorRef = system.actorOf(RabbitProducerActor.props(hostConfig, exchangeConfig), "producer")
 * }}}
 * is the preferred way to create this actor.
 *
 * The following is a listing of the message types that this Actor explicitly handles, and a brief discussion of their purpose.
 * {{{
 *  case r: Result =>
 *    When a new RMQ message is returned from the callback, take it, attempt to parse the ZooWork JSON out of it, and pass to the
 *    WorkGroup actor for handling. Decrement totalDemand, so that we do not attempt to consume the world.
 *  }
 *
 *  case ResultPackage(filename: String, results: Iterable[WorkResult], md5: String, sha1: String, sha256: String) =>
 *    After processing work, WorkPackages are submitted containing all component elements, be they failures or successes
 *  }
 *
 *  case ZooWork(primaryURI: String, secondaryURI: String, filename: String, tasks: Map[String, List[String]], attempts: Int) =>
 *
 *  }
 * }}}
 *
 * @constructor Create a new RabbitProducerActor, which consumes Scala formatted objects for serialization and delivery
 *             to RMQ. An example of such a message is a ZooWork, which is serialized to a JSON string, and sent to RMQ
 *             for reanalysis.
 * @param host: a HostSettings object, responsible for holding the server configuration to use.
 * @param exchange: an ExchangeSettings object, holds the exchange configuration.
 * @param resultsQueue: a QueueSettings object, holds the results queue configuration.
 * @param misbehaveQueue: a QueueSettings object, holds the midbehaved queue configuration
 * @param requeueKey: the requeueKey from the configuration file, used as the queue that Jobs will be requeued into.
