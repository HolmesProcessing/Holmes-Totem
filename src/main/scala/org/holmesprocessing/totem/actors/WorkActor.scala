/**
 * This actor represents the state of a message and its associated work within the system. As ScalaDoc's support for match
 * statement documentation is unsatisfying, the accepted messages types will be documented here.
 *
 * As this actor is effectively a stateholder, it is relatively fat. All knowledge about completed work, downloaded files, and
 * overall completion is held here. Actors terminate themselves at the completion of their work, or at the end of the timeout
 * cycle (currently 180 seconds). During termination, all completed work is sent to RMQ for storage into the cluster, and
 * incomplete work is requeued into the RMQ work queue for another attempt.
 *
 * This actor, after being created, immediately queues a download attempt with the Downloader actor.
 *
 * Something like:
 * {{{
 *   val myWorker: ActorRef = context.watch(context.actorOf(WorkActor.props(channel, key, value.filename, primaryURI, secondaryURI, value.workToDo), key.toString))
 * }}}
 * is the preferred way to create this actor.
 *
 * The following is a listing of the message types that this Actor explicitly handles, and a brief discussion of their purpose.
 * {{{
 *   case WorkComplete(work: TaskedWork, result: Option[WorkResult]) => {
 *     Each worker responds with a WorkComplete message after operating on some TaskedWork. These results are compiled,
 *     stored, and when either a timeout or full completion occurs, results are pushed to RMQ.
 *   }
 *   case FailedDownload(key: Long, attempts: Int) => {
 *     In the event that a download fails, the actor is notified, and attempts to download again (to a max of 3 times). Should
 *     the download fail entirely, Evict.
 *   }
 *   case qw: QueueWork => {
 *     Send the TaskedWork, as represented by workToDo, to the workers.
 *   }
 *   case Evict(key: Long, reason: String) => {
 *     When a death condition has been reached, send this message to self. Upon consumption, send whatever is needed to RMQ,
 *     Ack message, consume PoisionPill, and terminate.
 *   }
 *
 * }}}
 * @constructor Create a new WorkActor which holds and manages state for each message (ZooWork) that the consumer receives.
 * @param downloadconfig: a DownloadSettings, provides configuration options when downloading a file
 * @param deliverytag: a Long, represents the message's ID from RMQ.
 * @param filename: a String, the name of the file we are downloading.
 * @param primaryURI: a String, the first URI we will try to use for a download.
 * @param secondaryURI:  a String, the second URI we will try to use for a download.
 * @param workToDo: a List[TaskedWork], which represents all the work we need to do for this message
 * @param tags: a List[String], which contains all tags to be added to the result
 *
